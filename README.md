# Linear Algebra Assignment 1, 2

## Overview
### Assignment 1
Goal
• Write Python functions and test your codes for the following two topics that we have learned:  
• RREF  
• The number of necessary (integer) multiplications for the sequence of matrix multiplications  
### Assignment 2
1) Implement	a	function	that	calculates	a	determinant of	the	given	matrices	without	using	
NumPy	or	SciPy	libraries.
a. Implement	it	by	following	a	naïve	cofactor	expansion.
b. Implement	 it	 by	 following	 a	 Gauss-Jordan	 (Gaussian)	 elimination and	 the	
property	of	a	determinant	for	triangular	matrices.
2) Implement	codes	that	compare the	above	two	approaches and	report	your	results.
a. Measuring	times
i. Also, measure	the	time	when	you	use	the	det	function	in	the	numpy	
library	 (numpy.linalg.det) to	 compare	 it with	 your	
implementations. This	is	the	only	part	that	you	can	use	the	built-in	
function	in	the	numpy	library.
b. Number	of	multiplications	and	additions
c. Number	of	cycles
